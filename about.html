		When I was young, I was always fascinated with how characters were designed in comic books and video games. I saw my sister learning how to draw her favorite characters from various media, and I decided to follow in her footsteps to do the same. So I started to copy and trace the images of my favorite characters, and my love for drawing grew quickly.

Art became a way for me to express my ideas and creativity. I did not exactly grow up technologically priviledged like most of the children I saw in school. I used art and drawing as my way to entertain and distract myself. I knew that I wanted to become an artist early on, but the question was what kind of artist did I want to be? Video games eventually became a big part of my life, not only as a large distraction from my responsibilities, but as an outlet for me to impress myself into these worlds and characters to have a short respite from reality. It was not long before I decided my dream was to become a video game artist.

There is no story without its characters, and I want to be the one to create those relatable characters that have the same struggles as us; characters that we can grow to love and relate to; characters that will struggle and fall, only to get back up to fall again. I want to create worlds and stories that people can use as temporary escapes from the difficulties that life might bring.

I am currently studying Digital Media Art at San Jose State University and will be receiving my Bachelor's in Fine Arts Degree this Fall of 2019.
